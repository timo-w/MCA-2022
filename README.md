# Music Curation & Analytics 2022-23

## Week 1 Lab

> Identify a theme for your dataset. This will be the central, cohesive strand that will bring your data together. It can be an artist, composer, songwriter, performer, album, larger work (i.e. opera, musical, etc.), time period, genre, archival grouping, etc. You will want to be sure that you can gather all three types of data (musical scores, metadata, and audio recordings) based on your selected theme.

An Idea:
* Holst's "The Planets" Suite - Focusing on the identity of each piece in the suite, how they contrast, build their own character, etc.

> Based on your own experience, what do you think are some challenges to working with music and music-related data (perhaps related to access, curation, distribution, etc.)?

* insert challenges here

> How does your selected theme display some of these challenges? Describe the current manifestations of data relating to your selected theme, discussing how it is presently curated (collected and gathered) and how it is presented, described, and analysed.

* insert related challenges here
