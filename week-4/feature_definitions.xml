   <feature>
      <name>Pitch Class Histogram</name>
      <description>A feature vector consisting of bin magnitudes of the pitch class histogram described in the jSymbolic manual. Each bin corresponds to one of the 12 pitch classes, ordered in increasing pitch with an interval of a semitone between each (enharmonic equivalents are assigned the same pitch class number). The first bin corresponds to the most common pitch class in the piece under consideration (it does NOT correspond to a set pitch class). The magnitude of of each bin is proportional to the the number of times notes occurred at the bin's pitch class in the piece, relative to all other pitch classes in the piece (the histogram is normalized).</description>

      <name>Number of Pitches</name>
      <description>Number of unique pitches that occur at least once in the piece. Enharmonic equivalents are grouped together for the purpose of this calculation.</description>

      <name>Strong Tonal Centres</name>
      <description>Number of isolated peaks in the fifths pitch histogram that each individually account for at least 9% of all notes in the piece.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch</name>
      <description>Mean MIDI pitch value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. Set to 0 if there are no pitched notes.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Mean Pitch Class</name>
      <description>Mean pitch class value, averaged across all pitched notes in the piece. A value of 0 corresponds to a mean pitch class of C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer units from there (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the mean pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>

   <feature>
      <name>Most Common Pitch Class</name>
      <description>The pitch class that occurs most frequently compared to other pitch classes. A value of 0 corresponds to C, and pitches increase chromatically by semitone in integer untis (e.g. a value of 2 would mean that D is the most common pitch class). Enharmonic equivalents are treated as a single pitch class.</description>
